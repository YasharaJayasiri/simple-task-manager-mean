# Simple Task Manager - MEAN Stack

A simple **To-Do List web application** built using the **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).  
This application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently and improve productivity.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- View all added tasks
- Delete tasks
- Fully functional **CRUD operations** 
- Clean and responsive UI with centered layout

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB** – for storing task data
- **Express.js** – backend server framework
- **Node.js** – runtime environment for backend
- **Angular (latest version)** – frontend framework
- **HTML / CSS** – for UI design

## How It Works

1. Users can type a task in the input box and click **Add Task**.
2. Tasks are displayed below the input box in a list.
3. Each task has a **Delete** button to remove it from the list.
4. The app interacts with the **MongoDB database** through the Express.js backend, storing and retrieving tasks in real-time.
